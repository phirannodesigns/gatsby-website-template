> Gatsby Starter for Phiranno Designs

This is a template to build a simple Gatsby website.

All the images are served using the [Gatsby Image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) and styling is done with Tailwind.

Fonts are hosted locally wherever possible using [Typefaces.js](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces).

Hosting, DNS and form handling are all done with Netlify.
